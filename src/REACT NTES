//! how many times react excecutes initially ? -->


2 times bcoz we will be hving some testing methods initially to check so 
means we wll be having strict mode in index.js 


so we have to remove the strict mode then the code will be excecuted only once 
we can check it in console


 npx json-server --watch data.json  --port 4000  ------> everytime we have to run the database 
 once enter into the react app development



 //!npm i react-router-dom   syntax for package installation(routing and some inbuilt functions)


empty string ("") value is false
"chetan"  this value is true
